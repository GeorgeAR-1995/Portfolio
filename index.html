                <p>I am looking to make a career transition to become a software developer. 
                I have experience as a data analyst at a FinTech, mainly using SQL 
                and Python for scripting. I am 28 years old and live in Edinburgh. I enjoy sports, 
                mainly tennis and golf, but will try anything. I also try to travel as much as possible 
                with my partner and when we aren't abroad we are often enjoying the Scottish countryside with our dog.</p>

                <p>
                    A workout generator app. This was a JavaScript project where the aim was to create
                    a randomized output for the user. The output I chose was a workout planner which would 
                    select a body part to workout, 3 exercises and what sets and reps to perform.
                    <br>
                    Things that could be added but were out of scope: 
                    <br>- A nice front end design
                    <br>- More structure/personalisation in terms of longer term plans and limiting body parts to 2x per week
