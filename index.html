                <p>I am looking to make a career transition to become a software developer. 
                I have experience as a data analyst at a FinTech, mainly using SQL 
                and Python for scripting. I am 28 years old and live in Edinburgh. I enjoy sports, 
                mainly tennis and golf, but will try anything. I also try to travel as much as possible 
                with my partner and when we aren't abroad we are often enjoying the Scottish countryside with our dog.</p>
